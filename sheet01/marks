Q1
a) 1/1
b) 2/2
c) 1/1
   2/3 -- (2,3) and (4,5) are the same
d) 1/1
   1/2 -- Vertical/horizontal information: not clear what you mean.
Q2
begins with +3 points 
a) 1/1
b) 1(100)/3 -- need to vectorise histogram (also better to normalise)
c) 3(111)/3 -- but very inefficient code; would've been better if hist are normalised
Q3
a) 2/2 -- distance function runs very slowly; need to vectorise.
b) 2/2
c) 3/3
   1/3 -- need to connect the results back to lectures.
Q4
a) 4/4 -- curve doesn't look like pr curve
b) 3/6 -- adjectives are not good for describing scientific results: use specific numbers and binary comparisons. Also include key figures from the results to support your observations and conclusions. "look at the pictures" doesn't work; readers are not expected to inspect 43 plots one-by-one.

The coding is inefficienty -- the identification code requires more than 20 minutes to compute.
